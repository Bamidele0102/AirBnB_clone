## Project Description

Welcome to the Airbnb Console Clone â€“ a simplified command-line interface (CLI). This project is built as part of the ALX's curriculum project and provides an interactive shell for managing instances of different classes, such as User, amenity, city, place, state, review and the BaseModel where all other classes inherits from.

## Command Interpreter Description
The command interpreter is a fundamental component of the Airbnb Console Clone project, providing an interactive shell for users to interact with the application. It serves as a text-based interface where users can input commands to perform various operations, including creating, displaying, updating, and deleting instances of different classes.
